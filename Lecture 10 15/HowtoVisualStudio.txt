Array

An array is an aggreagate "data structure"
An arra is an continuous block of memory.

Declaring an Array
int myArray[10]; // this gives space for 10 ints
dataType arrayName[ArraySize];

Arrays are numbered starting with 0
and go to 1 less than their size

Two limitations to Arrays
1. They are fixed sized.
2. They can only store data of the type they are created with. Only INTS or what you declare it as. Also must be constant. 

3 Things you need to remember with Arrays. 
1. The name of the array
2. How big is the array.
3. How much is in the array.
