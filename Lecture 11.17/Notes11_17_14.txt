In C++, ________classes_______ puts together data and functions.

When we bundle data and functions together, that is called _____encapsulation_________.

_______Abstraction___________ is when we ignore details of something until we are ready to program that unit.


Classes vs. Structs

A Class and a Struct are almost the same except for 2 major differences.

1.Classes are __private__ by default


2.Classes start with the keyword class.


Methods

Functions that are included with in a class are called methods.
Data that are included with in a class are called fields.

The method that is called when an object of a class is created is called the ____constructor____________.


The job of the constructor is to: ___ initialize the private data.


Methods that update, or set, the fields to new values are called ________ setters________ or ________ mutators_________.


Methods that retrieve, or get, field values are called _____ getters______________ or _______ accessors____________.


Access Modifiers

There are two main access modifiers.

_____private________ means only the class can access the field or method.


_____public________ means the class and code outside of the class can access the field or method.


Generally, methods are always _____public__________ and fields are always ____private____________.
