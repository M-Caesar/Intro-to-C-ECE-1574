notes

The lifetime of a global variable, it will last until its 'scope' is finished. 

-Ask about static int

Input and Output

istream
	is the 'parent' of all input streams. 
	Ex:
	cin
	file
	input stream stream

ostream
	is the 'parent' of all output streams
	Ex:
	cout


stream
	c++ views data as streaming past, or through your program. 

we process our streams sequentially. 

We can 'read' data from our stream using extraction >> 
extraction will read as much data from the stream as it can until. 
	One of three things
	:it runs out of information
	: it encouters a piece of data that it doesn't know how to read or doesn't match operator. (putting a word into 'int')
	: encounters white space character. \t , space, or new line \n.

Extraction skips whitespace for you. 
If you were reading this file word by word. IT would see a space and then stop, 


input files

ifstream - the input stream for reading Input files. 

#include <fstream>
using std::ifstream;

To open a file, we need to 

1. declare our variable
2. open the file.
